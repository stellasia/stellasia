## GitHub

You will find here examples of my open-sourced work:

- [neomap](https://github.com/stellasia/neomap) is a React based application connecting to a Neo4j graph and showing nodes with spatial attributes on a map (leaflet behind the hood)
- [pygds](https://github.com/stellasia/pygds) uses some Python magic to use the Neo4j Graph Data Science plugin from Python easily (without having to write Cypher queries)
- [l4gims](https://github.com/stellasia/l4gims) is a Django + d3.js powered website built during a hackathon (and a few more hours to go beyond the demo effect)
