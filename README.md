I am a Physicist turned Data Scientist turned "graphista", using graph databases such as Neo4j or ArangoDB, graph algorithms and graph machine learning. I also like to develop stuffs, using Python, React or other cool language.

I am also the author of the book ["Hands-On Graph Analytics with Neo4j"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FBJ3B1S), published by @PacktPublishing, whose associated code can be found [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Graph-Analytics-with-Neo4j).

## Projects

You will find here examples of my open-sourced work:

- [Neo4j GraphRAG](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-graphrag) is a Python package to help you chat with your data leveraging Knowledge Graph and LLMs.
- [neomap](https://github.com/stellasia/neomap) is a React based application connecting to a Neo4j graph and showing nodes with spatial attributes on a map (leaflet behind the hood) (ARCHIVED)
- [pygds](https://github.com/stellasia/pygds) uses some Python magic to use the Neo4j Graph Data Science plugin from Python easily (without having to write Cypher queries) (ARCHIVED)
- [l4gims](https://github.com/stellasia/l4gims) is a Django + d3.js powered website built during a hackathon (and a few more hours to go beyond the demo effect) (from 2019)
